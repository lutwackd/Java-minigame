# Java Minigame

# How to Play
  * Hold the spacebar to change your player's color. When you feel it matches the background, release 
  * If your player is a close enough match to the background, 5 points are awarded
  * If the colors do not match, 1 point is deducted
  * You start at 0 points, need 15 points to win, and -10 points to lose
